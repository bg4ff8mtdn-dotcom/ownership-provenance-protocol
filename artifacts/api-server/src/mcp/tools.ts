 * validates its input using the exact same zod schemas the REST routes use
 * (imported from @workspace/api-zod, generated from the OpenAPI spec), then
 * delegates to the exact same shared service functions in
 * src/services/taskService.ts that the REST routes call. No validation or
 * ownership logic is reimplemented here.
 *
 * Each tool returns a ServiceResult-derived MCP result: on success, the
 * data as JSON text content; on failure, the same {status, error} the REST
 * API would have produced, as JSON text content with isError: true.
